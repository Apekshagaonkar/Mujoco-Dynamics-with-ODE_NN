# Mujoco-Dynamics-with-ODE_NN
ODE-Enhanced Neural Network Modeling for Irregularly Sampled Mujoco Dynamics

### Introduction
This project explores the integration of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) with neural networks to model the dynamics of multi-joint systems using the Mujoco dataset. Our focus is on interpolating irregularly sampled data to predict and analyze complex joint movements accurately.

### Dataset
We use the Mujoco dataset, which provides a rich benchmark for simulating multi-joint dynamics. The dataset includes subsets with irregular sampling intervals, challenging our ODE-integrated neural network models.
